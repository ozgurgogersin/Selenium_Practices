# Selenium_Practices
Welcome to my "Selenium Practice" repository! This project is a collection of Selenium WebDriver automation tests written in Java, designed to help me learn and practice web automation testing. Whether you are new to Selenium or an experienced tester, these tests cover a range of practical web testing scenarios.

##Some Key Features

- **YouTube Video Count:** Check how many "Selenium" videos are displayed on YouTube and print the title of the last video. This test involves scrolling and interacting with web elements.

- **Basic Calculator:** Use a web-based calculator to perform mathematical operations. This test demonstrates button clicks, data input, and result validation.

- **Table Search and Filter:** Search for specific data in a table on a sample webpage and print out the results. This showcases data extraction and validation.

- **Select Dropdown:** Select random days from a dropdown menu, stopping after choosing "Wednesday" for the 5th time. Print the count of how many times "Wednesday" was selected. This test focuses on dropdown interaction.

- **Wikipedia Participation Count:** Visit a Wikipedia page about the FIFA World Cup, find Argentina's participation count, and print it out. Please note that the test adapts to page changes.
